# Maze generator algorithm animations

I wrote these randomized maze generation animations back in 2009 and published them at no-longer-existing page http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/snuffy/maze/ .

I lost the original source code, but was able to re-discover it thanks to the [The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/snuffy/maze/), with some help from [hartator's Wayback Machine Downloader gem](https://github.com/hartator/wayback-machine-downloader).

The original versions found here are Java applets written with [Processing](https://processing.org/). I plan to convert them to JavaScript + HTML5 canvas.
